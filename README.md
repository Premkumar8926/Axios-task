- Edit existing users.
- Delete users from the list.


2. Git Commit History:
Commit your code regularly with meaningful messages:
- git init

- git branch -M main
- git push -u origin main


Final Notes

-The code provided is a basic example of how to perform CRUD operations using Axios in a React application. You may want to add additional features such as form validation, better error handling, and pagination.
-The mock API provided by jsonplaceholder.typicode.com does not actually save data, so any POST/PUT/DELETE requests will not persist.
-For a production environment, you should replace the mock API with your actual backend.
